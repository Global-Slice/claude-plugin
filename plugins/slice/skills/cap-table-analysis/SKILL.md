# Cap Table Analysis

## Ground Truth And Calculation Modes

Slice data is the source of truth for specific cap-table answers. Stay scoped to the authenticated company tenant and keep every analysis anchored to the same as-of `date` when possible.

Always label the calculation mode:

- Outstanding: issued shares on the legal share register.
- Fully diluted: issued shares plus share-settled grants, warrants, and convertibles where applicable.
- As-converted: preferred shares converted into ordinary-equivalent shares using the current conversion ratio.

Use assumptions only as a last resort and state them. Common defaults are private company, current tenant only, and equity-based awards.

## Company-Level Workflow

For cap-table-wide questions:

1. Use `companies_get_summary` for a one-shot company snapshot: company identity, total stakeholders, total grants, outstanding and fully diluted shares, and ESOP pool breakdown.
2. Use `cap_table_get_summary` for cap-table aggregates: company outstanding, company fully diluted, total available pool, totals by security type, and totals by share class.
3. Use `ownership_get_company_breakdown` when the question is specifically about outstanding vs fully diluted ownership totals.
4. Use `share_classes_list` and `rounds_list` to explain the share-class and funding-round structure behind the cap table.
5. Use `rounds_get_total_raised` only after discovering the round's share class IDs with `rounds_list`.
6. Use `cap_table_search_entries` for paginated per-stakeholder cap-table rows when aggregate totals are not enough.

Prefer `cap_table_get_summary` before `cap_table_search_entries`; it is cheaper and already includes the high-level share-class and security-type breakdowns.

## Stakeholder-Level Workflow

For questions about one stakeholder:

1. Resolve the stakeholder first with `stakeholders_search_by_name` or `stakeholders_get_by_customer_facing_ids`.
2. Use `ownership_get_stakeholder_breakdown` for that stakeholder's outstanding and fully diluted ownership. Set `includeBeneficiaryShares` intentionally based on the user's question.
3. Use `stakeholders_get_holdings` for the stakeholder's flattened securities across grants, shares, warrants, and convertibles.
4. Use `cap_table_search_entries` with `stakeholderId` when the user wants cap-table rows with share-class names, outstanding units, fully diluted units, status, and customer-facing IDs.
5. Use `securities_get_one`, `securities_find`, or `securities_get_by_customer_facing_ids` only for the specific securities that need full records.

When comparing a stakeholder to the whole company, pair `ownership_get_stakeholder_breakdown` with `ownership_get_company_breakdown` or `cap_table_get_summary` using the same date. For funds or investors that may invest through multiple entities or SPVs, check whether several Stakeholder records should be aggregated before reporting investor-level ownership.

## ESOP Pools

Equity Pool and Equity Plan are different: the pool is authorized headroom, while the plan is the rulebook for grants. For ESOP or equity-pool questions:

- Use `companies_get_summary` for company-wide ESOP pool totals and a compact pool breakdown.
- Use `equity_pools_get_summaries` for per-pool `poolId`, name, size, allocated, available, promised, and type at a date.
- Use `cap_table_get_summary` when the ESOP question needs `totalAvailablePool` alongside company outstanding and fully diluted totals.
- Use `securities_find` with `securityType: "grant"` and relevant grant filters when the user asks which grants or stakeholders consume pool capacity.

Report pool utilization as aggregated figures first: size, allocated, available, promised, and utilization percentage when calculable. Do not recompute pool availability from raw grants unless the tool output is insufficient; if you must reason manually, account for granted outstanding, exercises/settlements, cancellations/expirations returning to the pool, and any pool rules such as sold units being removed.

## Share Classes, Rounds, And Secondaries

Use share-class and round tools as reference data for cap-table interpretation:

- `share_classes_list` maps share class IDs to names and terms for the current date.
- `share_classes_get_one` fetches a full share-class record when one class needs deeper explanation.
- `share_classes_get_events` explains historical changes for a single share class.
- `rounds_list` maps funding rounds to their associated share classes.
- `rounds_get_display_data` is enough for selector-style round names and IDs.
- `rounds_get_total_raised` needs a comma-separated set of share class IDs discovered from `rounds_list`.

Founder shares issued at nil or nominal consideration are normal formation shares, not an error. At round close, distinguish primary issuances from secondary transfers: primary issuances create new shares and cash goes to the company; secondaries transfer existing shares and cash goes to the seller.

## Data Quality Checks

Watch for reversed or corrected events, multiple stakeholder entities for the same economic investor, stale valuations, tax-treatment mismatches, expired PTEP windows, anti-dilution conversion ratios, and pool expansion events. Event logs explain audit/workflow history; use current/as-of records and tool aggregates for state and ownership calculations.

## Large Requests

Avoid pulling the whole cap table or all securities into context unless the user explicitly needs raw rows. For large requests:

- Start with `companies_get_summary`, `cap_table_get_summary`, `ownership_get_company_breakdown`, and `equity_pools_get_summaries`.
- Apply filters in `cap_table_search_entries`: stakeholder, share class, security type, status, min/max shares, date, `limit`, and `offset`.
- Page with `limit: 50` and advance `offset` only while `hasNext` is true.
- Aggregate compact rows into counts, totals, top stakeholders, share-class totals, status breakdowns, or exceptions.
- Fetch full stakeholder or security records only for the small set needed to explain the result.

If the user asks for a large detailed cap-table export, explain that the right shape is a file report/export and avoid dumping the raw table into chat. Until that tool exists, return the key aggregates, notable rows, and the filters used.

## Response Style

Answer with the level of detail implied by the question: company totals for cap-table questions, per-pool summaries for ESOP questions, and stakeholder ownership plus holdings for stakeholder questions. Call out permission-scoped `null` or empty results: they can mean the caller lacks access, not necessarily that the data does not exist.
